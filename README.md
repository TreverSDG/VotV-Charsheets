Veil of the Void Reforged - Roll20 Sheets

These are the codes for the custom Character Sheet Templates on Roll20.

To use a custom character sheet on your game, you unfortunately must be a "Pro" level member. However, as long as you don't delete 
the game and have the character sheet up the entire time, you don't have to maintain the Pro status forever, just a one time purchase. 

Once you have your own custom game created follow the steps below to add the Character Sheet:

  1) Open the game you created and navigate to the "settings" button under the game title.

  2) Scroll down to the "Character Sheet Template" section and choose "Custom" from the drop down menu.

  3) Select the "Legacy Sanitization" checkbox to allow the current sheet to function properly.

  4) Copy our code from the "Roll20 HTML Layout" file into the "HTML Layout" tab of the custom character sheet.

  5) Copy our code from the "Roll20 CSS Styling" file into the "CSS Styling" tab of the custom character sheet.

After these steps, click the "Save Changes" button at the bottom of the screen and exit the page. 

Now, the Character Sheet should be accessible in the Roll20 game! 

While this has been tested and retested a lot, there are always going to be issues! Let me know if you find any and I will begin editing
the code!

Thanks!

Happy Storytelling Friends!
