Veil of the Void Reforged - Roll20 Sheets

These are the codes for the custom Character Sheet Templates on Roll20.

To use a custom character sheet on your game, you must be a "Pro" level member.

Once you have created a standard roll20 game, follow the steps below to add the Character Sheet:

  1) Open the game you created and navigate to the "settings" button under the game title (3 buttons to the right of the "Launch Game" button).

  2) Scroll down to the "Character Sheet Template" section and choose "Custom" from the drop down menu.

  3) Copy the full code from the "Roll20 HTML Layout" file into the "HTML Layout" tab of the custom character sheet.

  4) Copy the full code from the "Roll20 CSS Styling" file into the "CSS Styling" tab of the custom character sheet.

After these steps, click the "Save Changes" button at the bottom of the screen and exit the page. 

Now, the Character Sheet should be accessible in the Roll20 game! 

As with all code, there could be some misspellings or conflictions in the code. Let me know if you find any issues or have any feedback and
we will get it ready to go!
